# GlitchLogin

Welcome to **GlitchLogin**, a visually stunning and interactive login/signup page with a cyberpunk twist! Featuring glitchy text animations and a clever login button that dodges your cursor when you enter incorrect credentials, this project brings a unique user experience to authentication forms.

## Features
- **Glitch Text Effects**: Headings and labels flicker with a pixelated, digital distortion effect.
- **Dodging Button**: The login button escapes your cursor when the username is correct but the password is wrong.
- **Neon Aesthetic**: A sleek glassmorphism design with vibrant gradients and shadows.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Signup to Login Flow**: Create credentials and test them in a two-step process.
- **Attempt Counter**: Limits login attempts to 3 before locking the button.
